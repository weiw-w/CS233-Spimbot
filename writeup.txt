<Explain your team's strategy, implementation, etc.>

Our strategy:
    Since shooting the other bot can earn much more points, so that will be our main focus. We first 
    observe the map and find out the crucial traffic pivot of the map, the very center of the map.
    This road connects the left part and the right part of the map, so we decide to occupy this area
    to prevent the adversary from going from this area to our side and killing our bot. To implement our 
    strategy, we first check out the spawning position first and then move our bot to the top/bottom 
    coordinate of the vertical aisle and move up and down, shooting charge bullets in all four 
    directions, hoping to kill the adversary bot any time it enters the center area. 



vertical_loop:
    This function will only be called when the bot reaches the top or bottom of the center area from 
    the two spawning points. By checking the Y-value of our bot, we can determine which direction it 
    should move towards. With the MOVING function, the bot will move towards the given direction until 
    it reaches the end. It will solve puzzles at the two ends and the middle and shoot around every three 
    tiles.

respawn logic: 
    After respawning interrupt, we will assign a new variable RESTART to be 1. Since it won't be possible
    for the other bot to shoot our bot before we reaching the center area, we decided to check RESTART 
    every beginning of the VERTICAL_LOOP. We will jump back to our main program, if the competiton is 
    restarted.
